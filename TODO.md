Message for Help:
"Hey, Iâ€™m working on a Next.js 15 project where I need a form to create elements with a description input. The input should allow users to type or paste formatted text (like bold for important words, lists, and new lines). I also need to save this data (probably in state or a database) and render it on a preview page while keeping the formatting intact. Can you help me implement this using Next.js, React state management, and possibly a rich text editor or Markdown support?"

This makes it clear that you want:
âœ… A form with an input field for the description
âœ… The ability to control text formatting (bold, lists, new lines)
âœ… The ability to save and render the formatted text on a preview page
âœ… A Next.js-friendly solution

When you're ready, just send me this message, and I'll help you with the best approach! ðŸš€
